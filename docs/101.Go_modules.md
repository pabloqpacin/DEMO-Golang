  - Hello, World:
    > - This file tells the go tools essential information about your code. If you planned to distribute your application, you would include where the code was available for download as well as information about dependencies. The name of the module, example.com/hello, usually refers to a URL where the module can be found and downloaded. For compatibility with tools we'll start using soon, make sure your module's name has a dot somewhere in it, like the dot in .com of example.com/hello. For now, your module file is minimal, and you can leave it that way. To read more about modules, [you can check out the reference in the Golang documentation](https://go.dev/blog/go116-module-changes). We can get back to testing and learning Go now since the tests should run, even on Go 1.16.
    > - In future chapters, you will need to run go mod init SOMENAME in each new folder before running commands like go test or go build.
