# Go Syntax Misc

- Iteration
  - For loops
    - [@gobyexample: for](https://gobyexample.com/for)
    - [@gobyexample: range (Arrays & For loops)](https://gobyexample.com/range)

- Data types
  - Strings
    - [strings functions](https://pkg.go.dev/strings)
    - Performance: [Builder](https://pkg.go.dev/strings#Builder)
    - [stdlib: fmt (formatting)](https://pkg.go.dev/fmt): `%.2f` for float precision (2 decimal places), `%#v` for structs...
  - Slices
    - [@effectivego: slices](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go#slices)
      > - Go does not let you use equality operators with slices. You could write a function to iterate over each `got` and `want` slice and check their values but for convenience sake, we can use [reflect.DeepEqual](https://pkg.go.dev/reflect#DeepEqual) which is useful for seeing if any two variables are the same.
      > - It's important to note that `reflect.DeepEqual` is not "type safe" - the code will compile even if you did something a bit silly. [...] So while using reflect.DeepEqual is a convenient way of comparing slices (and other things) you must be careful when using it.
      - **(From Go 1.21, slices standard package is available, which has [slices.Equal](https://pkg.go.dev/slices#Equal) function to do a simple shallow compare on slices, where you don't need to worry about the types like the above case. Note that this function expects the elements to be [comparable](https://pkg.go.dev/builtin#comparable). So, it can't be applied to slices with non-comparable elements like 2D slices.)**
      - Slices can be sliced! The syntax is `slice[low:high]`. If you omit the value on one of the sides of the `:` it captures everything to that side of it. In our case, we are saying "take from 1 to the end" with `numbers[1:]`.
